## Goal

This repo contains examples of how to add *Basic Authentication* to a Now deployment using various languages / frameworks, along with some numbers that show the differences between each method.

## Structure

- The `_static` directory contains all the static stuff each implementation serves for demonstration purposes : HTML, CSS, images...
- All the other directories are the different ways you can add Basic Authentication to a Now deployment. Checkout their code to see how to implement it in your project
